# Documentation

# Design rationale

Trying to simplify and accelerate things.

# Pending work

- Create some infrastructure for this

  - An EC2 instance
  - A public ip of some kind
  - A place to receive a webhook (maybe some nice ass route53)-

- deploy the dependency scanner

- test it with 1 repo

- deploy a bunch of aws tools that can be useful

- create a nice interface to set it up

- Create a flask based interface for all the reports

- Test with a simple account, or it's own

- Expand tools and keep dreaming.
